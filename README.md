# ERC404_Token_Market

Welcome to the DN404 NFT Marketplace, your gateway to the future of digital asset trading! Powered by the versatile ERC404 token standard, our platform offers seamless integration of ERC20 and ERC721 functionalities.



* ERC404s are a new token standard on Ethereum, combining the fungibility of ERC20s with the uniqueness of ERC721 NFTs.
* The concept of ERC404 evolved from a failed project called EMERALD, but was refined and launched with the token PANDORA, which has grown to a market cap of over 100M.
* An ERC404 contract creates an NFT and a token simultaneously at a preset ratio. For example, PANDORA has a supply of 10K NFTs and 10K PANDORA tokens.
* The NFTs and tokens in an ERC404 contract are linked. If a user resells the NFT or sells the token, the NFT they hold is burnt, and the contract mints an NFT to the new address. If the users transfer the NFT, they lose the token, and the new address gets the token.
* ERC404s can help reduce NFT trading friction and increase project liquidity due to their fungible token component, addressing a common issue in NFT collections which often suffer from liquidity issues due to trading primarily in an auction format.
